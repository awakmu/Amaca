Amaca (pronounced: am√†ca) is a simple te,plate engine written in C, which
natively supports Lua scripting. This means that you can create your tamplates
without the need to learn yet another templating language. You'll need just a
minimal knowledge of the plain and simple Lua.

## USAGE

Amaca consists of just two functions:

    char *Amaca_template(char *template, ...);

Which takes as argument a template string and a list of key-value pairs to pass
to the template code, which will be available within the Lua scripts.

    char *Amaca_template_file(char *filename, ...);

It's the same as the previous function, but it takes as argument the path to a
template file.

The templates are just plain text strings/files containing blocks of Lua code.
The code blocks have to be enclosed between `{{` and `}}`.

See the `eg/example.tmpl` file for a template example, and the `eg/example.c`
file for a (very simple) code example.

## INSTALLATION

Amaca is distributed as source code. Install with:

    $ git clone git://github.com/AlexBio/Amaca.git
    $ cd Amaca
    $ make

You can also copy-paste the `amaca.{c,h}` files inside your project and use a
custom Mkaefile to build it.
