/**
 * Amaca_template - parse and eval a given template string
 * @param template Template string
 * @param nargs The number of the following key-value pairs
 * @param ... List of key-value pairs to pass to the template
 *
 * This function parses and evaluates the given template string, and returns
 * a pointer to the resulting string (returns NULL on failure). It also
 * optionally takes a list of key-value pairs that are passed to the template
 * as Lua variables.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   char *result = Amaca_template(
 *       template_string,
 *       "my_var1", "Var1 content",
 *       "my_var2", "Var2 content"

 * Amaca_template_file - parse and eval a given template file
 * @param filename Template filename
 * @param nargs The number of the following key-value pairs
 * @param ... List of key-value pairs to pass to the template
 *
 * Just like Amaca_template() but takes as argument a template file instead
 * of a string. It also optionally takes a list of key-value pairs that are
 * passed to the template as Lua variables.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *   char *result = Amaca_template(
 *       "/path/to/file.tmpl",
 *       "my_var1", "Var1 content",
 *       "my_var2", "Var2 content"
