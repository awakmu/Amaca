Amaca's documentation!
=====================

Amaca (pronounced: am√†ca) is a tiny template engine written in C, which natively
supports Lua scripting. This means that you can create your templates without
having to learn yet another templating language. You'll need just a minimal
knowledge of the plain and simple Lua.
